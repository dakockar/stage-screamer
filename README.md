# stage-screamer

## Description

Stage screamer is a top-down shooter game. The player is on the stage of a rock concert hall. She controls the angle of the loudspeakers on both sides and tries to shoot the enemies that are coming from across the room with her screams.
The game ends when one of the enemies reaches the player. 
The score is kept based on the count of the enemies that are killed. If it is less than a certain number, player loses. Otherwise, the player reaches the goal.

- playes wins or loses depending on the score (to be decided later)
